"""Binary Indexed Tree is represented as an array.
Each node of the Binary Indexed Tree stores the sum of n elements (power of 2) of the input array.
depending on the updating process"""


"""Given any integer, which has a binary format, i.e., a sum of powers of 2"""

"""e.g., 9: 1001 = 8 1000 + 1 0001, i.e., the 1 bits in the number"""

"""
For getting sum, the child node BITree[x] of the node BITree[y] stores the 
sum of the elements between y(inclusive) and x(exclusive): arr[y,â€¦,x). 
- The parent of index i in the getting tree is:  
i -= (i & -i)
e.g., 12 1100 - 0100 = 8 1000, thus 8 is the parent of 12
"""

"""
For updating BITree[x], we need to add the value to all its ancestors. 

It stores the sum from x to its smallest child, e.g., 

e.g., suppose we have 8 numbers
             8 
         4    6   7
        2  3   5
      1
      
BITree[1] stores sum from 1 to 1 arr[0:1]
BITree[2] stores sum from 1 to 2 arr[0:2]
BITree[4] stores sum from 1 to 4 arr[0:4]
BITree[8] stores sum from 1 to 8 (arr[0:8])
BITree[6] stores sum from 5 to 6 (arr[4:6])


For updating BITree[x], we need to add the value to all its ancestors as well because it is within its ancesters' sum range
e.g., update BITree[1] will need to update BITree[2], BITree[4], BITree[8]

How to determine parent and construct the BITree from 1 to n?

- The parent of index i in the updating tree is: 
i += (i & -i)
e.g., 4 0100 & -4 1100 = 4 0010
Thus 4 0010 + 4 0010 = 8 0100 thus 8 is the parent of 4
